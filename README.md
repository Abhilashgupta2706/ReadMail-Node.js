# ReadMail-Node.js

This repository contains my NodeJS practice codes. <br />

### About this project

I made this project because when I was working as a software developer I had this requirement from a client to Excel data from an email's attachment using Angular & Node.js
So I thought why should not create a small separate personal project which I can share on my repository?

Note: I have just given 2 input fields for Email ID and password. You can pass data from those fields as a parameter to the API and use them.
